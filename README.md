# Financial_Crash_Landscape_Analysis_using_TDA
Topological Data Analysis of a Financial Time Series for insights from Landscapes for detecting Financial Crashes

The goal of this study was to replicate the results of the original paper by Gidea and Katz (2017) and draw special inferences on the usage of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) as a novel method to identify warning signs for impending nancial crashes. This was done by a multivariate time series analysis of four major US stock market indices, namely the S&P 500, Dow Jone Industrial Average (DJIA), NASDAQ, and Russell 2000. The usage of persistent homology to identify and quantify topological patterns is illustrated here. Persistence of detected transient loops are measured and then encoded into real-valued functions referred to as 'persistence landscapes'. Their temporal changes are quantied via their Lp norms.
